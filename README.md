# **CognoRise Infotech Internship**

**Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases the projects I developed during my internship at CognoRise Infotech.**

## **About the Internship**
During my internship at **CognoRise Infotech**, I had the opportunity to work on several projects that enhanced my skills in Python programming, GUI development, and problem-solving. Each project in this repository is a testament to the knowledge and experience I gained during this internship.

## **Projects Included**
### **1. Calculator App**
   - A fully functional calculator built using Python and Tkinter.
   - Features include basic arithmetic operations, square, square root, error handling, and a sleek user interface.

### **2. Sudoku Solver**
   - A Python-based Sudoku Solver that efficiently solves any given Sudoku puzzle.
   - Utilizes backtracking algorithms to fill in the missing numbers while adhering to Sudoku rules.
   - Includes a simple GUI using Tkinter for inputting puzzles and displaying the solved grid.

### **3. Countdown Timer**
   - A user-friendly timer application that counts down from a specified time.
   - Built using Python's Tkinter for the GUI and `time` for time-related functions.
   - Supports pausing, resuming, and resetting the timer, making it versatile for various tasks.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all projects.
- **Tkinter**: For creating graphical user interfaces.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Implemented in the Sudoku Solver for efficient puzzle solving.
- **Time Module**: Used in the Countdown Timer project for managing time functions.

## **How to Run the Projects**
1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate** to the project directory.
3. **Ensure** you have the necessary Python packages installed (e.g., `tkinter`).
4. **Run** the Python scripts using your preferred Python interpreter.

## **Acknowledgments**
I would like to express my gratitude to the team at **CognoRise Infotech** for providing me with this opportunity and guiding me throughout the internship. The experience has been invaluable in my journey as a developer.
